# Discord-Nitro-Generator-Checker
This is an open-source Discord Nitro Generator written in Python. All Code is belonging to cutieQue, meaning you have no rights to copy / modify this code.
Please understand it took ages to make this.
# Features
+ Nitro Code Generation, amount you choice!
+ Nitro Code Checking while Generating.
+ Summary Screen Once Finished Generating.
+ Discord Webhook (Valid Codes get posted straight to a Discord Webhook!)
# Things To Note
All Nitro Codes are Randomly Generated, before you reply with "fAkE nItRo CoDeS wErE aLl InVaLiD!" just remember that it is super unlikely you will get a valid code. 
# How To Install
Firstly Run "install.bat" or go to your Terminal and paste in "pip install -r requirements.txt"
Then Run "START.bat" and you should be good to go!
You MUST Have The Latest Version of Python installed [(Python 3.7.12)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3712/) (recommended). I Am not sure how smoothly or if it would run at all on other versions!
