## Discord-Nitro-Generator-Checker
This is an open-source Discord Nitro Generator written in Python! Please Do Not Copy, unless you Credit!
## Features
+ Nitro Code Generation, amount you choice!
+ Nitro Code Checking while Generating.
+ Summary Screen Once Finished Generating.
+ Discord Webhook (Valid Codes get posted straight to a Discord Webhook!)
## Things To Note
All Nitro Codes are Randomly Generated, before you reply with "fAkE nItRo CoDeS wErE aLl InVaLiD!" just remember that it is super unlikely you will get a valid code. 
## Installation
+ GIT 
`git clone https://github.com/cutieQue/Discord-Nitro-Generator-Checker.git`
Run `"install.bat"` 
or go to your Terminal and paste in `"pip install -r requirements.txt"`
Then Run `"START.bat"`
and you should be good to go!

You MUST Have The Latest Version of Python installed [(Python 3.7.12)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3712/) (recommended). I Am not sure how smoothly or if it would run at all on other versions!
